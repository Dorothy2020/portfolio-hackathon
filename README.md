## main.js

This JavaScript code provides functionality for a responsive navigation menu and smooth scroll animations. It controls the toggling of the menu, updates the hamburger icon, animates the header on scroll, and reveals sections as the user scrolls.

Key Components:
Navigation Menu Toggle:

Controls visibility of the navMenu using the nav__menu--open class.

Toggles between hamburger (ri-menu-3-line) and close (ri-close-line) icons.

Closes the menu when a navigation item is clicked.

Header Scroll Animation:

Adds/removes header--scroll class to the header when scrolling beyond 40px.

ScrollReveal Animations:

Uses ScrollReveal to animate elements like .hero__content, .about__content, and .footer__content.

Elements are animated with custom durations, delays, and origins (e.g., top, left).

Code Behavior:
Menu Toggle:

Toggles the nav__menu--open class and updates the icon using the changeIcon() function.

The menu closes when any navigation item is clicked.

Icon Change:

Changes the hamburger icon to a close icon when the menu is open, and vice versa.

Initial Page Load:

On load, ensures the icon reflects the menu's state.

Header Scroll:

On scroll, adds/removes the header--scroll class based on the scroll position.

ScrollReveal Animations:

Animates elements with varying durations, distances, and delays based on their class.
