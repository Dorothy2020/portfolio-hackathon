## ✍️ Step-by-Step Design Process

### 1. Low-Fidelity Mockup (Sketch on Paper)

### 2. High-Fidelity Mockup (Figma Design)

I created a  high-fidelity prototype using Figma, with a focus on:

- Typography & spacing  
- Layout scaling (tested on MacBook Pro 16”)  
- Text alignment and responsiveness
